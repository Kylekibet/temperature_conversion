# Temperature Conversion

A simple command-line temperature converter that converts between Fahrenheit and Celsius.

## How to Use

1.  **Run the program:**
    ```bash
    cargo run
    ```
2.  **Enter the temperature with its unit:**
    The program will prompt you to enter a temperature value followed by its unit (C for Celsius or F for Fahrenheit), e.g., `80C` or `100F`.

3.  **View the result:**
    The converted temperature will be displayed in the terminal. The program will automatically convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, or Fahrenheit to Celsius, based on your input.

If you enter an invalid format or unit, the program will prompt you again until a valid input is provided.
